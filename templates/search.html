<h1> Search </h1>
<!-- Thing which would be cool to do: have people tell me if they're searching by author or series 
    and modify the form to show the proper fields depending on user input -->
<form action="undecided" method="POST">
    Seach by: <!-- Use the buttons or something, things which only allow one option -->
    <!-- If it's series, go through goodreads
    If it's an author, go through Google Books, because I think that's better?
    Then submit the form and... huh. Do I need it on a different page altogether?
    Well, I need to check if preventDefault prevents the update from going back the the server
    Since I would like to update the search history in some way
    And I rather NOT code that all in the page because that feels weird
    It would be cool to make it show up dynamically though
-->
</form>
